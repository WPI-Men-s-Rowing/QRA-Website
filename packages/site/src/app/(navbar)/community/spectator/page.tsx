            Among the most physically demanding sports, rowing at a world-class
            level requires excellent conditioning. Upper body and leg strength
            are of equal importance as athletes row 2,000 meters (roughly 1.25
            miles) in an average of six minutes, depending on the number of
            athletes per boat. Brought to the East Coast of the United States
            from Great Britain in the early 19th century, the sport is rich in
            sportsmanship and tradition- coxswains of winning boats are thrown
            into the water and the prize for the winner is literally the shirt
            off a competitor&apos;s back.
          </p>
          <p>
            One, two or four athletes enter the sculling events, in which each
            athlete uses two oars. Rowers each use one oar in the coxless pair,
            coxed pair, coxed four and coxed eight events. In these events,
            sweep oars are positioned alternately on the sides of the boat, or
            shell (note that one rower in a sweep oars event would result in a
            boat going around in circles). In the coxed events, a coxswain
            steers the boat by pulling on wires attached to the rudder and
            advises the crew on racing tactics. The eight always carries a
            coxswain and is a remarkable event to watch; the boat is
            approximately 62 feet long (roughly the distance from home plate to
            the pitcher&apos;s mound on a baseball field) and moves at nearly 15
            mph.

        <div className="lg:text-2xl text-xl flex flex-col gap-5">
          <p>
            The four parts to the rowing stroke- catch (blade in water, knees
            bent, arms forward), drive (legs straight, arms drawn toward body),
            finish (oar out of the water, blade horizontal), recovery (body
            forward, blade turned from horizontal to vertical) - should all flow
            together in smooth powerful movement.
          </p>
          <p>In addition, the following are crucial for top rowers:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc px-5">
            <li>
              Continuous motion - Rowing should be a continuous fluid motion.
            </li>
            <li>
              Synchronization - Rowers strive for perfect synchronization with
              crew members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clean catches of the oar blade - A lot of splash means the oars
              aren&apos;t entering the water correctly. The catch should occur
              at the very end of the recovery, when the hands are as far ahead
              of the rower as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Oar blade coordination - As the blades are brought out of the
              water, they should move horizontally at the same height, just
              above water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consistent speed --Shells move slowest at the catch, quickest at
              the release. A good crew times the catch at the right moment to
              maintain the speed of the shell.
            </li>
            <li>
              Strokes per minute - Stroke rates vary from boat to boat,
              depending on the number and size of the rowers. At the start, the
              stroke rate will be high (40-44 strokes per minute for an eight,
              36-40 for a single). The rate slows down during the middle of a
              race to 32-36 for an eight and 28-32 for a single. Finishing
              stroke rates - the sprint over the final 500m- can be as high as
              46 strokes per minute.

        <Header>Competitive Categories</Header>
        <div className="lg:text-2xl text-xl flex flex-col gap-3">
          <p>
            Rowers are categorized by what boat they row, how old they are, how
            well they row, what their gender is and how much they weigh. The
            descriptions below explain all possible categories. At the 1995
            USRowing National Championships, categories are limited to elite
            open and lightweight events for men and women, as well as junior
            events for men and women.
          </p>
          <strong>By Ability</strong>
          <p>
            There are three national achievement categories: Intermediate,
            Senior and Elite. Intermediates can become Seniors by winning a
            first place at a designated &ldquo;status-changing&ldquo; event, the
            National Championships for example. If an Intermediate rower wins
            the Senior Men&apos; Single Sculls at the Nationals, he then becomes
            a Senior Sculler. As soon as that happens, he can no longer enter an
            Intermediate sculling event. Elite rowers represent the highest
            categorical level of rowing competition in the United States and
            compete at the World Championships and the Olympic Games.
          </p>
          <strong>By Gender</strong>
          <p>
            There are men&apos;s events and women&apos;s events. In a few
            regattas there are also mixed events. In a mixed eight, for example,
            there would be four men and four women.
          </p>
          <strong>By Age</strong>
          <p>
            There are junior events for rowers under 19 years of age, senior
            events for rowers over 19 and masters events for rowers over 27.
          </p>
          <strong>By Weight</strong>
          <p>
            There are two weight categories, lightweight and open weight.
            Lightweight men cannot weigh more than 160 lbs. and the average
            weight in the whole boat cannot exceed 155 lbs. Each competitor in
            the lightweight women&apos;s events cannot weigh more than 130 lbs.
            and the average boat weight cannot exceed 125 lbs. Lightweight can
            row in open events, but open weight athletes can&apos;t row in
            lightweight events unless they qualify. Lightweights have to weigh
            in before the event.
          </p>
        </div>
        <Header>The Start</Header>
        <div className="lg:text-2xl text-xl flex flex-col gap-5">
          <p>
            At the start, each of the six boats is held by the stern on starting
            pontoons and the bows are aligned by aligners.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rower in the bow seat may raise his/her hand to indicate the
            crew is ready, until the starter conducts a roll call of the crews.
            After the roll call, the starter raises a red flag, gives the
            warning command &ldquo;Attention&ldquo; and then gives audible and
            visual signals to start the race.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crews are allowed only one false start, which is called when a crew
            leaves early or has equipment breakage in the first 100 meters of
            the race. It is not uncommon for an oar to break, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the crews begin, one or two launches follow, carrying a
            driver and a judge-referee. The primary responsibility of the
            judge-referee is to ensure that all boats are racing in safe
            conditions and that every crew has an equal opportunity to win.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crews are allowed to leave their lanes (in fact, a crew may begin in
            lane 1 and finish in lane 6) as long as their movement doesn&apos;t
            interfere with another crew&apos;s opportunity to win, or does not
            physically endanger the crew.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a boat is close to interfering with another shell, the
            judge-referee will direct the crew by calling its name and pointing
            a white flag in the direction the boat should move to avoid trouble.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judge-referees positioned on the finish line tower or platform
            determine the placing of each boat, with the assistance of timing
            and photo-finish equipment. &ldquo;Winning by a bow ball&ldquo;
            refers to the 2-inch rubber tip on a shell&apos;s bow that is used
            to indicate the winner in close races where photo-finishes are used.

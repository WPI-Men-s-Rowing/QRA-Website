              Do not “sit” in areas marked “No Sitting” turn and move to the
              sides of the lake immediately
            </li>
            <li>
              The areas marked shallow are extremely shallow, stay clear of them
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the arches closest to shore on the Route 9 Bridge at your own
              risk
            </li>
            <li>
              To reverse direction, turn 90°, row directly across the lake and
              complete your turn on the other side
            </li>
            <li>
              Crews must pass single file through the narrows in both
              directions. Crews traveling north should move to the Shrewsbury
              shore after clearing the narrows
            </li>
            <li>
              Crews may turn around an island but must do so counterclockwise
            </li>
            <li>
              No more than three shells may travel abreast in the same
              direction. When traveling three shells abreast, launches should be
              behind or between boats
            </li>
            <li>
              Coaches must slow launches to minimum wake speed when passing
              other crews or scullers
            </li>
            <li>
              Appropriate navigational lighting must be used on all shells and
              coaching launches when rowing from sunset to sunrise. Strobe
              lights are recommended in addition to navigational lights for
              increased visibility
            </li>
            <li>
              Use of any megaphone by coaches prior to 7 AM or after 8 PM is
              prohibited. Radio communication between coaches and rowers is
              recommended during these times. Coxswains should use cox-box
              systems at minimum volume and should keep voices down to minimum
            </li>
            <li>
              Coaching launches must be identified with the institutional name
              in 2 inch lettering on each side of the motor
            </li>
            <li>
              All races and race times will be assigned by the QRA under the
              QRA’s race permits with the Lake Commission and the Environmental
              Police. Race schedules will be posted by Thursday of each week in
              March, April and May on the QRA website, at each boathouse, and at
              the Corazzini boat ramp. Rescheduling of races after they are
              posted is prohibited. A coach responsible for each day’s racing
              will also be assigned at that time
            </li>
            <li>
              Some race and practice days may have a reverse traffic pattern.
              That will also be posted by Thursday with the race schedule (if
              applicable), at each boathouse, and at the Corazzini Boat Ramp
            </li>
            <li>
              Coaches and rowers should always consider safety to be the primary
              rule and should never launch in unsafe conditions, and, should
              land as soon as possible if unsafe conditions develop while
              rowing. The QRA recommends that each launch be equipped with a
              cell phone for emergency situations
            </li>
            <li>
              The QRA considers being a good neighbor to be the most important
              after safety. We consider our neighbors to be other boaters of any
              kind and lake residents
            </li>
            <li>
              Rowing community rules will be enforced by QRA Rules Enforcement
              Subcommittee

              When launching please have all equipment including oars at dock.
            </p>
            <p>Place oars in oar racks.</p>
            <p>
              Launch to the right. Crews must take no more than 2 minutes on the
              dock if there are other boats waiting to launch. Pull off of dock
              and immediately to the right into the cove beyond boat ramp to tie
              in. Do not stop right off of the end of the dock or block boat
              ramp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crews must be headed northbound when landing. Pull to the far
              right shore after the gazebo (completely off the course) and
              proceed along shore to landing dock. The area between the gazebo
              and the landing docks is large and completely off the course. Do
              not stop your boat and wait on the course to land.
            </p>
            <p>
              Southbound crews that want to land must continue south to the
              narrowing at the gazebo and cross the course there. Northbound
              crews always have right of way over crossing crews. Bring crew
              along shore completely off of the course to land. A crew should
              wait to cross well to the right off of the course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crews must take no more than 2 minutes from landing to have the
              boat out of the water when there are crews waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crews may not cross the highlighted area of the course when
              launching or landing.
            </p>
            <p>
              At busy times coaches must monitor their crews to make sure that
              they launch and land within 2 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
              During scheduled racing, boats participating in racing always have
              priority when launching and landing to boats that are not racing.
            </p>
            <p>Safety and courtesy should always be the priorities.</p>
